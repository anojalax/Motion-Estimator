#If STA is desired on scan chains, the set case for the scanEn must be set to ‘1’
#All four types of analysis can be accomplished by using the following commands:
# Reporting setup time and hold time. Primetime by default reports the setup time. Youcan report the setup or hold time by specifying the delay_type 
# Reporting timing with capacitance and transition time at each level in the path
# save your session and come back later if you chose to.
