# Motion-Estimator
Design Motion Estimator wih minimum power and chip area using Verilog

System Requirements:
• 16x16 Reference Block
• 31x31 Search Window
• Each stored in one two-read-ported memory
 In reality one memory per frame
• Grey-scale coded pixels (8 bits/block)
• 4096 reference blocks in a frame
• Conduct search at 15 frames per second
(Encoding does not have to be real time)
• Clocks available : 130, 260 MHz
• 0.25 μm CMOS library
